# Employee-Payroll

Subjrct
Every week/month in a company you have to calculate (and send) the salary to each employee.
There are different types of employees:
1.employees paid by the hour
2.employees with a fixed salary
3.employees paid with commission on sales made
4.employees who fall into the intersection of two categories, for example, (2) and (3).
There is a payment scheduling: each employee is paid with different timing, e.g.,
 • those paid by the hour are paid every week,
 • those on salary are paid every month, etc.
